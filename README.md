# QuizzICAL

QuizzICAL is an interactive, computer-adaptive learning system that makes it possible
to deploy computer-adaptive testing technology for the purpose of providing students
with guided practice exercieses at their level while simultaneously working to improve
it.

This is a modern remake of my undergraduate research project from 2006 using
modern technologies (Python + React/Redux). The goal of the original project was to
simultaneously offer a method to continuously reevaluate the parameters of the questions
themselves without needing to perform initial calibration.

The original project was written in ASP.net

Done:
- The data model + CRUD
- Basic user authentication
- The Item Response Theory engine

Still in Progress (was part of the original project)
- Authorization with roles
- Question difficulty reestimation
- Support for multiple question types
- Question categorization by concept
- Support for ability estimation by concept
